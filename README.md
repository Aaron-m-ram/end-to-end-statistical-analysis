Project Intro/Objective
The main purpose of this project is work on a final project for AAI-500 (Probability and statistics for Artificial Intelligence). The goal is to take a dataset, clean the dataset, perform an exploratory data analysis, select a model, and analyze the model.

Project Description
The dataset used is titled "Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US Adults (35+) by State/Territory and County". 
.* Datasource: National Vital Statistics System. Three year average, age-standarized, spatially smoothed county rates that can be displayed by gender and race/ethnicity. There are 1000 records & 19 variables. 
.* Data dictionary:  
Questions:
...* Are there differences in heart disease mortality rates and gender?
...* Are there correlations between geographical locations and heart disease mortality rate?
...* Is there a correlation between race and heart disease mortality rates?
...* Are their environmental factors, for example, climate or pollution, that correlate with heart disease mortality rates?
.* What specific data analysis, visualization, and modeling work are you using to solve the problem? 
.* What roadblocks and challenges are you facing? etc.
