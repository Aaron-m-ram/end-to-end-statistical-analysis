Project Description<br>
The dataset used is titled "Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US Adults (35+) by State/Territory and County". 
<br>Datasource: National Vital Statistics System. Three year average, age-standarized, spatially smoothed county rates that can be displayed by gender and race/ethnicity. 
<br>After cleaning our dataset we have about 743 records & 7 variables. <br>
<br>Data dictionary:  
<br>Questions:
<br>* Are there differences in heart disease mortality rates and gender?
<br>* Are there correlations between geographical locations and heart disease mortality rate?
<br>* Is there a correlation between race and heart disease mortality rates?
<br>* Are their environmental factors, for example, climate or pollution, that correlate with heart disease mortality rates?
<br>* What specific data analysis, visualization, and modeling work are you using to solve the problem? 
<br><br>What roadblocks and challenges are you facing? etc.
